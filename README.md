  <h4>Repositories</h4>
In Git, Repositories are a sort of data structure which store files and directories along with metadata about the changes that those files has undergone. Repositories contain all project data. When a repository has its first comit, its state is saved. This is where you project timeline begins. 
<h4>Branches</h4>
In Git, branching is when you diverege from the main branch when working on a repository. When you start a repository, a main branch is created and is usually where the main working project is being worked on. When you create a branch from the main project, it is usually to add a feature or a fix a bug in the project. 
<h4>Commit</h4>
Commits are the core building block units of a Git project timeline. Commits are snapshots along the timeline of a Git project. They are stored in your local repository.
<h4>Stashes</h4>
When you want to switch branches but your work is not complete in the current branch you are in, you might not want to commit half done work. Stashing on git allows you to save your work and switch branches without commiting the current branch.
<h4>Merging</h4>
Merging in Git is when you combine a working branch back into your main branch. The changes you made in your working branch are implemented into the main branch when you merge if there is no confilicting code.
