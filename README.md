<summary>Important Terminology</summary>
<h4>Repositories</h4>
In Git, Repositories are a sort of data structure which store files and directories along with metadata about the changes that those files have undergone. Repositories track all changes made to files in your project, building a history over time. 
<h4>Branches</h4>
In Git, branching is when you diverge from the main branch of a repository. When you start working on a repository to add a new feature or fix a bug, you essentially make a new branch.
<h4>Commit</h4>
Commits are the core building block units of a Git project timeline. Commits are snapshots along the timeline of a Git project. They are stored in your local repository.
<h4>Stashes</h4>
When you want to switch branches but your work is not complete in the current branch you are in, you might not want to commit half done work. Stashing on git allows you to save your work and switch branches without commiting the current branch.
<h4>Merging</h4>
Merging in Git is when you combine a working branch back into your main branch. The changes you made in your working branch are implemented into the main branch when you merge if there is no confilicting code.
